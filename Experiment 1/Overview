### Experiment 1 - Baseline Foraging and Regulation
**Objective:**
This experiment assessed the agent’s ability to adapt to small spatial shifts without retraining.

*Environment*:
* Two essential resources distributed in a 10 x 10 grid.
* Continuous physiological depletion.
* Discrete embodied actions (movement, consumption, sleep)

*Comparison agents*:
* Random agent
* Greedy agent
* CTCS-HRRL / HJB agent

**Experiment 1 Implementation Logic**:

Two stationary resources were placed at fixed locations — R1 at (0.5, 4.25) and R2 at (3.5, 1.5) with full availability throughout training.

*Testing environment:* A local spatial perturbation was introduced, with R1 moved to (1.0, 4.25) and R2 to (3.5,2.0).

### Experiment 3 - Oscillating Resources
**Objective:**
Test the agent's ability to adapt to faster temporal dynamics using the same learned model.

**Experiment 3 Implementation Logic**:

Two moving resources with full availability oscillated between two fixed positions during training. The oscillation period was set to T = 1000 steps for both resources. R1 oscillated horizontally, while R2 oscillated vertically.

*Testing environment:* The oscillation speed was increased to T = 500 for R1 and T = 750 for R2.

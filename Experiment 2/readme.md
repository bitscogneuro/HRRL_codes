### Experiment 2 - Probabilistic Resource Dynamics
**Objective:**
Test the agent's ability to cope with increased scarcity and uncertainty using the same trained policy.

**Experiment 2 Implementation Logic**:

Two stationary resources were available 90% of the time during training, introducing stochastic uncertainty.

*Testing environment:* Resource availability was reduced to 80%.
